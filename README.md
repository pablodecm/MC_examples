# Examples and applications of Monte Carlo methods

This repository will host some examples of the application and implementation
of Monte Carlo methods. This was homework for my Masterâ€™s studies at University
of Cantabria. Also used to learn how to create matplotlib animation and their
use within IPython Notebook.

# Requirements

Several Python numerical libraries are required in order to execute the
examples provided:

* IPython
* Numpy
* matplotlib
* JSAnimation

# Notebooks (online access)
